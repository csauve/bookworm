# Bookworm üêõ

Bookworm is a [BattleSnake][1] bot written in [Rust][2] for the March 2020 tournament. Combines the strategies of pruned turn tree exploration, minimax, and heuristic scoring. The snake is given a time budget to explore the turn tree; the fewer the snakes, the deeper the exploration.

## Building and running

Just run `cargo build --release` to produce a self-contained binary at `target/release/bookworm`. The binary can be invoked with a number of modes and options, which the `-h` flag explains in detail. The available modes are:

* **server:** Runs as a typical snake API server, ready to be play.
* **host:** Locally hosts a match between given snakes, logging each turn state. Implements 2020 rules.
* **benchmark:** A series of common operations are timed and logged.

## Development

Unit tests can be run with `cargo test`, though some strategy tests will fail currently. To quickly build and run the bot, use `cargo run <mode>`. Note that the development build is significantly slower at runtime than the release build, so you may need to increase the `--timeout` for host mode and give the server more time budget with `--budget` to achieve similar lookahead depths.

### Todos and improvement ideas:
* Heuristics and strategy
  * Implement more unit tests for behaviour
  * Seed the turn tree exploration with some longer term "plays" instead of just single space movements
  * Allow for chances of death instead of assumed worst case
  * If death unavoidable, prefer head-to-head
  * Are there heuristic elements we can skip sometimes?
* Performance
  * Can I write some `const fn` to move work to compile time?
  * Can I use fixed arrays or `vec![0.0; src.len()]` anywhere?
  * Look for places to use `.copied()` instead of `.cloned()`
  * Avoid indexing into vecs; use `if let Some(x) = vec.get(i)`
  * [infallible DS][3] to avoid empty checks
  * Move hosting to `us-west-1` to be closer to BS host
* Pathfinding (if used)
  * JPS
  * Dynamic heuristic weight
